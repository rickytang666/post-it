## Inspirations

We wanted to bring back the joy of exploring. Turn everyday spaces into a shared, interactive canvas. Make city exploration fun, social, and personal again.

## Features

- **Place Notes**: Tap anywhere to anchor a sticky note to that location
- **AI-Generated Icons**: Gemini AI converts your voice message to appropriate prompts, which is passed to **Snap3D API** to generate symbolic 3D models

- **Toggle View**: Switch between symbolic icons and full note text, fully controllable by hand gestures
